# AESHelper
AESHelper is a simple utility for encrypting and decrypting files and folders using the AES algorithem.

To use AESHelper just download and run the latest installer from the releases tab. Then right click on any file or folder and you should see AESHelper Encrypt and AESHelper Decrypt buttons.

Version 1.0 has been tested with Windows 10 only but all the code should work on older versions of Windows. Linux and Mac OS are not officially supported as of version 1.0 but in the future I will be releasing a .Net Core version of AESHelper which will run on Linux and Mac OS.

To report bugs or request features please create an issue in the issues tab.
