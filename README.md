# AESHelper
AESHelper is a simple utility for encrypting and decrypting files and folders using the AES algorithem. To use AESHelper just download and run the latest installer from the releases tab. Then right click on a file or folder and you should see encrypt and decrypt options.

Tested with Windows 10 only but all the code should work on older versions of Windows. It's unlikely that this program will work in Linux as of now but in the future I will be releasing a .Net core version which runs of Linux and Mac OS.
